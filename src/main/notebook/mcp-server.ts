Reuse them directly — do NOT re-read a file or recompute data that is already held in a variable from an earlier call this session.',

Pass language: "python" (default) or "r" to select the interpreter for the cell. Do NOT pass a runtime or environment here — the cell runs in the session\'s bound runtime (see notebook_bind_runtime), or the app-managed default when nothing is bound; there is no per-call runtime switching. Each bound runtime is a SEPARATE namespace (variables/imports do NOT carry across runtimes); change it with notebook_switch_runtime, and create a named environment first with manage_environments before binding to it.',
