//   - 'dead'    : positively confirmed gone / not ours (ESRCH/EPERM, or a reused pid) → safe to reconcile.
//   - 'unknown' : could NOT prove the child died (a live pid whose reuse we can't prove — a matching or
//                 unreadable start token, or no token at all on macOS/Windows/legacy) → a survivor MIGHT
//                 still be writing, so we must NOT clean staging / a prefix nor signal it; block and leave
//                 the journal entry for a later startup instead of destroying data under a live writer.
// Collapsing 'unknown' into 'dead' (the old boolean) is exactly the bug: it cleaned live processes' dirs.

// There is deliberately NO 'alive' state. We never auto-signal a child: a persisted pid (+ start token)
// can't give a strict "this live pid is still ours, safe to SIGKILL" guarantee (tick-coarse token; a
// probe→kill race could hit a reused pid). So a confirmed-live child is 'unknown' — recovery BLOCKS its
// target and leaves the entry, and the env self-heals on a later boot once the pid is gone. 'dead' means
// provably gone or provably reused (safe to reconcile); 'unknown' means "might be live" (block).
