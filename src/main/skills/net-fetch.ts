// proxy the user's browser uses. Node's global fetch (undici) ignores that proxy and takes a direct
// path, so in proxied environments GitHub returns 403 for the direct requests while net.fetch succeeds.

// A `typeof fetch`-shaped view of net.fetch for callers that need the full Response API (`.text()`,
// AbortSignal, arbitrary headers) rather than the narrow FetchLike shape — e.g. the provider-validation
// probe, which reads the error body and aborts on timeout. Same proxy-honoring Chromium stack. A lazy
// arrow wrapper (like netFetch) so `net.fetch` is only read at call time — reading it eagerly at module
// load crashes any test whose electron mock omits `net` — while the method call preserves the receiver.
